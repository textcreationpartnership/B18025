            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is long ſince, <hi>Thotimus,</hi> that you did me the favour to pitty me, and to feel for me the Pains of my Solitude, I have often taken the liberty to anſwer you, that it is to me no great misfortune to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: permit me to teſtify to you this day, that I should be to blame to tire my ſelf, and that I have here company, that is well worth all other that I should be able to ſee.</p>
            <p>I can at leaſt aſſure you, that during our converſations, the ſad ſpectacles, and affrightful ſilence of the deſert, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune yet keeps me, doth not hinder, that the hours do not paſs there very ſwiftly, and that time were one of the things which are wanting.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy for you to judge, that I ſpeak of <hi>Solomon.</hi> You know that formerly I did comfort my ſelf in Books: you are about to ſee in the writing that I ſend you, that I imploy my ſelf now to explain them; and to endeavour by my refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to make the wiſe men of the
<pb facs="tcp:206831:6"/>World ſee Truths unknown to their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
            <p>I thought of it immediately at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into this Solitude where I am. All melancholic as it is, or as it appears to your eyes; I know nothing more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, for a man who would buſy his thoughts, or meditate on the writings of this learned Prince. I ſay it, becauſe I believe that I read lately, that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom who dictated theſe Proverbs when it was ſolitary, explains them not, but to perſons who are ſo alſo, and who go to ask it, as he did, in places where one hears no news of the Creature, nor any noiſe capable of troubling the attention, and the pleaſure of thoſe that hearken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> loved to be alone, as much as the Princes of his Court to be near him, and to hear him ſpeak. The time to which his deſires aſpired was, When after the labours of the day, weary of the affairs, of the honours, and the noiſes of the World, he could retire himſelf from the ſight of company, and when
<pb facs="tcp:206831:6"/>he went to entertain himſelf with God in a Country-houſe called <hi>Hetta</hi> near enough to the City.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed him more then any of the Royal Houſes, becauſe that beſides the magnificences, and the riches added by the hands of men, there were great Woods, with Rocks and Streams and other workmanship of nature, proper to raiſe his ſpirit to Heaven, and to make him remember eternity.</p>
            <p>It was in this ſtately deſert, at the ſight of the beauties of God, that his contemplations diſcloſed to him; That he conceived ſuch great contempts of the beauty of mortal things; and that after the other complaints that he made, againſt the treacheries of their promiſes and their flatteries, he ſung this famous Song, that the Caves and the Waters of his palace firſt heard, but its eccho's have been ſince heard through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and shall be made to reſound, even to the end of ages, <hi>Vanitas vanitatum, cuncta vanitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moral and politic ſentences,
<pb facs="tcp:206831:7"/>of which his Book of the Proverbs is filled, and thoſe which the Son of Syrach has brought together and kept by his care, were born in the ſame ſolitude where ſilence and tranquillity help'd them into the World: And it is without doubt, That to theſe devout walks, that the univerſe is obliged for the knowledge of the truths which are gone out of the Pen of this learned Prince, which have enlightned all Nations I have choſen amongſt theſe ſentences, thoſe of which I believed I could be able to help my ſelf, in working at my deſign, which is to draw from their Texts, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of meditation, proper for perſons who would live amongſt the Laws of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Prudence, and conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſely in the various occaſions of a civil life.</p>
            <p>It is but a little peece as it appears. If I had had a little more leaſure and a little more light, perhaps it should have been bigger: But to ſay with an Ancient, if I had more of one and the other, in ſtead of enlarging, I should endeavour to shorten
<pb facs="tcp:206831:7"/>it, and I should remember what one of the beſt Writing-Maſters of our time told me, <hi>That to excell in the Art of writing well, it is neceſſary to be able to blot well out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thought is not only his, I obſerve; it is common to the Maſters of every Art and Science, and that it keeps even the firſt rank among their Maxims.</p>
            <p>When they are willing, that what they do should be their Maſter-piece, all their induſtry is imployed to make it paſs well into the Spirit and to leave there but little matter.</p>
            <p>Force and delicacy are the perfections of all works: that of a Book is ſoveraign, when it can be read in few hours, and that it can not be read, nor meditated enough in many years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much Truth, few Words,</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the device of a great Divine; very great in that, but infinitely leſs than God, who encloſeth infinite truths in one word alone, and who ſaith all that can be ſaid to eternity, when he pronounceth his word.</p>

                        <p>Stop a moment and conſider well the Wiſdom of God, when he propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the meeting of theſe three ſo different things, and to form thereof the chief of his work?

                        <p>Grace repelled and withdrawn the Soul, there's reprobation and ſin. The Body ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Soul there's death. The

                        <p>That which ſeems more wonderful and which we ought particularly to conſider, is that thoſe debts, which have not ceaſed to increaſe ever ſince you have been born, and do yet encreaſe every day with your age, have preceeded your birth, and are more ancient than your ſelf.</p>
                        <p>You have begun to live, but you have not begun to mind, your ſelf; Before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and before time, God was, and you were loved.

                        <p>Oh unſpeakable favour! Oh Soveraign and infinit honour! But it is a very terrible thing, in this ſo glorious life, that each mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where you live without any love of God, is a moment of ſin, and that all the moments of ſin and ingratitude, shall be reckon'd and examined at the hour of your death.</p>

                        <p>Compare them from hence forth, and do at the feet of the Croſs, before your Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and your Father, what you will do that day before your Judge, when that you shall ſee the truth written in the Book where all is written.</p>

                        <p>In like manner, let it appear on your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and by the Conduct of your words and actions, that you are not ignorant, that in the midſt of felicities and honours of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as in the middeſt of the richneſs of a ſtately Tomb, you are nothing but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or a little ashes hid there under: that you hold before them the Rank of a Judge or a Maſter, but that before God you have no other but that of Nothing and Sinner.</p>

                        <p>When you are in Companies where 'tis rare to find a man who knows himſelf, and ſpeaks modeſtly and humbly, be ye humble, but take heed, that you are not ſo by affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanity.</p>

                        <p>Do not ask one to ſlander you; have only a care of being offended when one does, and endeavor to be humble enough to deſire one should do it: Praiſe not thoſe who ought to be blamed; content your ſelf to condemn no body.</p>

                        <p>Say then, you who are rich and happy and who want nothing, when you ſee on the ſtraw a Begger cover'd with ſores and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, dying of hunger and cold; ſay, Behold my shadow, there is what I should be, had it not been for the particular goodneſs and care which God hath had of me.</p>

Withdraw your ſelf gently and help your ſelf in ſtretching your hand to mercy who offers you his.

                        <p>Learn that the moſt Divine action of his power and love is to change into good the evil that you have done.

                        <p>Although true contrition burſts the heart, it has yet ſomwhat of ſweetneſs that bears it up, and which makes it known and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth it from a falſe repentance.</p>
                        <p>The two marks moſt certain that we are in that condition God would have have us, are Tranquility and Humility. Aſſure your ſelf that every affair where there is too much

                        <p>All humility which makes you fear that there is no pardon for you, and that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth your tears, is falſe and deceitful, it leads you to impenitence and the death of the proud and reprobates.</p>

                        <p>For, Alas! how many ſellers of evil councils, are there about a man, who has means to buy them? And how many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes undertaken by ſuch kind of councils have ruined the undertaker, and enriched the Counſeller?</p>
                        <p>The cuſtome, or the Maxim of the wiſe Man, when one brings him advice, is to hearken to them, and to receive them ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, as a friend; to examine them as a Judge, and to execute them as a Maſter.</p>
                        <p>When he does, what one hath counſelled him, he follows not the opinon of another, but his own.</p>

                        <p>In one word, one of the moſt inviolable rules of prudent and experimental policy; is to examine others, on his own affairs and the reſolutions that one has taken; and to be aſſured that in ſuch occaſions, the moſt clear ſighted men become blind, aſſoon as he is alone.</p>

                        <p>COnſtancy ought without doubt, to be put among the moſt laudable and chief perfections of humane Wit; but its name and its colours, ſerve often to cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hardneſs, and to make it to be put in the rank of vertues and heroic qualities.</p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:206831:44"/>
                        <p>The true conſtancy, conſiſts not in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling firmly what we have juſtly and wiſely reſolved: It conſiſts in willing always what Juſtice and reaſon requires of us.</p>
                        <p>Many deſigns are good in one day, who are not in another, and it can eaſily happen; That what was yeſterday deliberated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Wiſdom to be done, would be folly to execute to day.</p>
                        <p>The wiſe Man is conſtant and firm; his Soul is immortal and invariable, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions are not ſo. As they are bound to circumſtances, dependant on time and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they ought to be changed, according as the changes and motions of the World take away from them the conformity they had to reaſon.</p>
                        <p>It is the duty and perfection of a Cock on a Dial to be always ſteady, without ever changing of place; but this should be a great diſorder, if its shadow ſtood ſtill alſo.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that our reaſon has no honour, nor advantage above mortal things, but as it hath of firmneſs and immortality more then they. Yet it should ceaſe nevertheleſs to be reaſon, and to be the living Image of the Wiſdom, and eternity of God, if its deſigns were unchangeable.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid it, and I have reſolved it, it shal be done then, whatſoever shall happen; ſee, there's the Wiſdom of God, the ſin of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:206831:45"/>Angel, and the folly of man amongſt the moſt ridiculous fools, there are certain little Wits, which ſpread themſelves, that they might be enlarged; and who think that it is to meaſure themſelves with the Wits of the firſt rank; and to become Heroes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible is to render themſelves inexor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>On each new occaſion we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view our reſolutions, and conſider if pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gives us not new orders, and if there is nothing to change in our wills.</p>
                        <p>This new order, perhaps may be on the part of this prudence, To ſee at our feet a multitude of perſons beſeeching, and a multitude of new tears, worthy to touch and to ſoften the heart of Man.</p>
                        <p>Tenderneſs deſtroys neither conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy nor courage. Gold hath ſo much the more ſplendor and force, and is ſo much more perfect and pure, as the fire has ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
                        <p>Our noble Soul is never more noble nor never more couragious, and more Divine, then when it is made tender by a juſt compaſſion, and comforts the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in pardoning a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or in quitting any reſolution, of which the ſeverity would be a public affliction.</p>

                        <p>ONe of the moſt shamefull, and uglieſt deformities, that can happen by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of nature, is to have a ſtreight heart.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe who have it in that manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the world adore them, are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Where the Heart is little, the reſt is ſo likewiſe, in deſpight of fortune.</p>
                        <p>It is thereby that we meaſure men, and it is thence, wee judge that in a Citty, the moſt numerous part of the inhabitants ought to be called little people.</p>
                        <p>Others who are elevated above thoſe, are not ſo by purple, nor ornaments. If there had not been great courages among us, there had never been Princes. Men have not made them Maſters of the world, but becauſe they found hearts as great as it.</p>
                        <p>The heart of thoſe men,
<note place="margin">Ipſe dabit tibi Cor.</note> is the heart which God gives. Behold and aſpire.</p>
                        <p>Endeavour at leaſt, to frame your example to his, and to mark upon your actions, ſome ſtrokes of his character, which is, as I have ſaid, a goodneſs magnanimous and bold.</p>
                        <p>Have courage: doe nothing that can be able to wound your reputation, or your Conſcience: love honour, and obſerve its
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:206831:47"/>two lawes, of being incorruptible and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                        <p>Permit not, that avarice, or any looſe hope, render your ſoul a ſlave; let the love of your duty alone be the ground of your actions.</p>
                        <p>Poſſeſs your liberty and enjoy the right proper to God alone, to doe nothing by conſtraint or intereſt. Be you independent as to mortall things, diſingaged from your paſſions, raiſed above the favours, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and above the threatnings of fortune, invincible by violence or flattery.</p>
                        <p>But joyn to this firmneſs of ſpirit, all that you can of ſweetneſs, and the graces of a good nature.</p>
                        <p>Without looſeing any thing of your vigour, endeavour to become by love and good will, that which Gold, the firmeſt of mettals becomes by the fire, tractable, and capable of receiveing all ſorts of shapes.</p>
                        <p>Let each find his humour in you, without finding his faults there. Accomodate your ſelfe to the inclinations of perſons, to their cuſtomes, their affaires, their ſentiments; and feare not undervaluing your ſelfe by this complaiſance. Remember, that to appear moſt noble, and to keep the firſt rank of honour in Company, is to be the moſt ready to doe, all that Civility requires on every occaſion, and moſt proper to doe it, with a good grace.</p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:206831:47"/>
                        <p>Tis true, that your humour, to be the humour of a wiſe man, ought to be alwayes equal, and always the ſame, but this laudable evenneſs conſiſts in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly of the humour of others / and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelfe to the condition, wherein you find their ſoul, in the various accidents of mortal life.</p>
                        <p>Know you what comforts them, what afflicts them, what toucheth them, and be you your ſelfe touched thereby = as of things which are common to you.</p>
                        <p>By a true ſympathy; feel you their pains, and make them ſee on your countenance, and in your words, the marks of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conformity.</p>
                        <p>Obſerve worthily, and faithfully, the rules of friendship; and judge that the immenſe greatneſs, of a noble ſoul, conſiſts in its being peſent by its cares, and the application of its thoughts, to each part of the Dutyes, that juſtice and friendship pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to it.</p>
                        <p>It is no great vertue to love perſons, who pleaſe you by the ſplendor of their fortune, or the fair qualities of their witt and nature.</p>
                        <p>But tis ſo, when you love thoſe truly that you love; of any humour or any condition that they can be,</p>
                        <p>Have here in the ſentiments of <hi>Solomon.</hi> That which was particularly admirable in his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:206831:48"/>Conduct, was, that the precious friendship contracted with ſo many Princes, as he knew in the world, hindered him not from having a tender affection, for the officers of his court, and even for the meaneſt of the ſlaves that laboured in his houſe, and of whom he knew he was beloved.</p>
                        <p>He beleeved that the fidelity and love of ſervants, can not be juſtly recompenſed,
<note place="margin">Si eſt tibi ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus fidelis, ſit ti bi quaſi anima tua.</note> but by the love of their maſter: and that the heart of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of men, when he loves his King ſincerely and without intereſt, is not leſs worth then the heart of a King.</p>
                        <p>He looked on himſelfe as their father, and one of the fineſt exploits of his wiſdome and faithfulneſs, was to have ſo done, as that no body entred into, or dwelt in his houſe who was not faithfull, and that no body went out thence, who was not rich.</p>
                        <p>Their fortune entred into the number of his own affaires: hee even felt his owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities ceaſe to pleaſe him, when he ſaw any of his Domeſticks, who ſeem'd to have no share therein, and who carried in his eyes any mark of ſadneſs or diſquiet.</p>
                        <p>Let your Principal and firſt buſineſs in the exerciſe of your charge be, to aſſure your ſelfe of the good will, &amp; to deſerve to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:206831:48"/>loved, of thoſe who ought to obey you.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever name of Prince, Lord, or Magiſtrate, that you bear in a Province or City, believe this, That you shall not have any power, nor be really the Maſter of any thing, but when you shall be the Maſter of Hearts.</p>
                        <p>But obſerve, that to be beloved of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the firſt leſſon is, in loving them, love nothing but their perſons, ſeek nothing elſe by your goodneſs towards them, but the pleaſure of obliging them without intereſt, and the honour of loving them ſincerely, and that without hope.</p>
                        <p>That of feigning love, is a wicked trade, and by acting the part of a friend on the ſtage of the World, by promiſes and comical civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; A Man learns nothing, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and betray himſelf. In the art of gaining hearts the great ſecret, is to love naturally, and that without art, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection it ſelf, and (if I might ſo ſay) without vertue.</p>
                        <p>Love is ſo much the more powerful over the will, and ſo much the more vertuous and more admirable, as it doth without vertue the good it doth, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low nothing but its inſtinct the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Divine charity it ſelf is not perfect, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:206831:49"/>when it is transformed, into the nature of the charitable perſon, and that it is become his inclination and its weight.</p>
                        <p>Futhermore, let clemency be inſeparable from your perſon, and let it enter into all your Councils. Be ſevere in words and actions, when you muſt be ſo: but then, have you another tongue and other hands beſides your own. Imploy not your hands, but when you muſt diſtribute favours, and let not your tongue ſerve you but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce edicts of mercy and love.</p>
                        <p>Take not thoſe for enemies, who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely afflicted for having diſpleaſed you; And when its neceſſary to punish any guilty perſon, do not give him time, if poſſible, to repent before your face, and have recourſe to your goodneſs. If his tears and his grief prevent you; believe that you have loſt the rights of your anger; and endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the Maſter of Kings and Judges, who cannot punish ſinners but in the time that they are proud, and who doth not make the miſery of any one, to continue eternally, but becauſe they love eternally their malice.</p>

                        <p>The immortal ſoul follows motion, and goes where heat and fury leads it, It takes deſigns, and conceives blindly, inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opinions, foolish and deceitfull hopes, and impetuous deſires.

                        <p>The worſt of it is, that when it finds it ſelfe there, it is ashamed to retire thence. It falls there, by folly, and it abides there by Pride. Man coverd with darkneſs, and filled with errours, plunged in filth and

                        <p>The vigour of thoſe is worth much, and it deſerves the reputation that it hath in the World.</p>
                        <p>The Patience of theſe, although the World prize it leſs, is much more worth; it is the moſt neceſſary and ought to be moſt honoured.</p>
                        <p>The one and the other have been always put in the firſt rank, of the moral vertues; and they are thoſe, that have given the name of Great to the <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> and the <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> and which have made the Heroes of old adored.

                        <p>ONe demands what this Courage is. Every body anſwers? It is eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ones ſelf therein and to take appearance for truth.</p>
                        <p>Many do ill to put it in the number, of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the heats of their corrupted nature; and to believe, that it is no other thing then

                        <p>Courage is not of the number of the paſſions, it is their Maſter; nature keeps it in the middle of them, not as a Criminal amongſt its Accomplices, but a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour amongſt his Slaves, to keep them in duty and ſubject them to labour. Their fires are different from his, but they are fit to ſerve him.</p>
                        <p>Some perfwade themſelves, that this which we call true Courage, is a Military Angel, who during combats, enters into the ſoules of the Heroes, and there produceth the Marvels that we admire.</p>
                        <p>Others, That tis only the inſpiration, or the breath of this Angel, which pusheth on the hearts of ſouldiers, and gives motion to armies.</p>
                        <p>The moſt wiſe, have very wiſely ſaid, that it is a ſpiritual flame, kindled by the Creator, in the higheſt part of our Soul, as a ſtarr in the higheſt part of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>A peaceful and regular flame, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, incorruptible, ardent, pure and fruitfull, alwayes faſtned to Heaven and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:206831:54"/>buſy on earth, by an inexhauſtible ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of influences, neceſſary for the conſervation of the repoſe, and life of the people.</p>
                        <p>But whatſoever Courage may be, do not you believe, that to be couragious you are obliged to take arms, and go ſeek enemies in far Countreys. Abide where you are, and make warr againſt your paſſions; you shal do (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) more than thoſe who wear the ſword.</p>
                        <p>When that you pardon injuries, and by a generous patience you ſuffer ſlanders and calumnies, you are better then the ſouldier that revengeth them.</p>
                        <p>And it is more honourable to you, to ſtop in you, any tranſport of anger, or to repell in you, any thoughts which flatter you and draw you to ſin, then to deſtroy an Army and to take Cities.</p>
                        <p>Your greatneſs and your glory, is not to abaſe others before you; but to be great in your ſelfe, and to have above thoſe, an elevation independent on their fall or miſery.</p>
                        <p>When you overcome your irregular impatience, and you reſiſt the motions, that carry you to looſe actions, that are prohibited by duty; you make your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and your vertue to be believed, when you overcome ſtrange enemies,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:206831:55"/>it encreaſeth nothing that is in you; The defeat of an Army leſſens the number of men, but it adds not a jot to your ſtature, nor one degree of perfection to your ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>In one word, prize patience. I do not ſay, contemn vigour: Although 'tis not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as this victorious patience, I confeſs 'tis worth much and deſerves the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all ages have had for it. But further, that the one and the other to be perfect, ought not to be ſeperated; becauſe they are the two parts of courage, the two halfs, of one and the ſame whole that ſeperation will neceſſarily weaken and obſcure.</p>
                        <p>There is no courage, nor nobleneſs, nor ſupream grandour in a Soul, where theſe two vertues are not together: 'tis only by their union; that they have the power, to carry men to the moſt eminent degree of heroic Glory, and to give to their actions this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine luſtre which dazles the eyes of the World, and which obliges fame, to ſpeak of them to all Nations and in all ages.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that it is an illuſtrious thing, and very juſtly to be applauded and admired by the people, to ſee what courage doth in a Prince; when that during a battel, push'd on by this coeleſtial fire, He paſſeth unhurt through all the furies of death, and runs (upon an Army overthrown) after victory which calls and leads him.</p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:206831:55"/>
                        <p>In like manner, it is true, That there is another ſpectacle yet more rare and more worthy of public admiration, to ſee a Prince, when in the midſt of triumphs and ſucceſs, and amongſt the moſt glorious feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of humane life; he can contemn what he poſſeſſeth, and that he viſibly declares by his modeſty, and by the fidelity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that he had rather loſe all that, and loſe Empires and Worlds too, if he had them, then to commit an action of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
                        <p>But to ſee theſe two marvels united, and tyed to each other in one and the ſame Conqueror; To overcome the enemies of the State, and to overcome himſelf, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Wiſdom and moderation by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats; to encreaſe in goodneſs by victories; to take Towns and gain Hearts; to be the moſt beloved and moſt dreadful of men, without doubt, is the moſt ravishing ſight under Heaven. I do not know whether the Ancients have ſeen it with their eyes, or if poſterity shall ſee it in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
                        <p>All the ſentiments of this true Courage, are heaped together in theſe two words. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye then to fear Men, and to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Army; and rather to dye, then not to fly at the ſight of dangers which threaten the Conſcience; and preferring the intereſts
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:206831:56"/>of ſelf love, or a looſe paſſion, before the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fidelity.</p>
                        <p>If you are not of the condition, nor the humour to ſay the former; or if your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular profeſſion, ſubject you to the Laws of the Goſpel, oblige you to pardon all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: comfort your ſelf in remembring, That it is a Prince more valiant then the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and more enlightned from God then the Prophets, who aſſures me. <hi>Melior eſt patiens viro forti, qui dominatur animo ſuo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnatore urbium.</hi>

                        <p>It is better to want nourishment then an employ. The man who wants the one, or the other will perish. The difference is, That by hunger, a Man dies without disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and very ſoon; and by idleneſs, he dies shamefully and ſlowly.</p>
                        <p>The beauty of the mind, the goodneſs of the nature, the force of Courage, and the purity of the Conſcience, retain ſomwhat of the nature of Fire: they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue nor preſerve themſelves, but by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action. To render them immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is to extinguish them; and this is that, which idleneſs doth, which by its criminal repoſe, deſtroys more things then time by its agitations, and by its courſes that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws every thing. The worſt is, that this idleneſs does yet more then death, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts that which is moſt incorruptible and Divine within us.</p>
                        <p>Time has not been able to do any thing againſt the Sun, this ſix thouſand years: there would need but one days idleneſs to deſtroy it</p>
                        <p>There would need but one hour, nay leſs, to deſtroy the innocence and fidelity of the Soul, that all the cruelties of Tyranny and the flatteries of Pleaſure, had not been able to corrupt during ſo many years.</p>

                        <p>One finds no where ſins, ignorances, nor even follies nor deſpaires, as in ſouls who have nothing to do, but torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                        <p>We begin to converſe from the Cradle, and yet we know not at the age of ſixty, how 'tis to do it well. We unlearn even by ſtudy and exerciſe; and by how much the more we advance in age, by ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable is our fault.</p>

                        <p>Be you better learnt and modeſter: Let them ſpeak when you have ſpoken; Give others leave to anſwer you, and have the power to hold your Tongue when they ſpeak. Shew them that you can hearken

                        <p>Men of great witt and an excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can mingle theſe familiarities, and feigned quarrels with reſpect, and hinder that among the repartees of a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

                        <p>Their faculty paſſeth yet further. They know to mingle the ſame reſpect, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primands and threatnings and even in true angers.</p>
                        <p>A wiſe man can ſpeak as a Maſter to a ſervant, without ſlandering him, and without ſaying a word of which he could be offended.</p>
                        <p>He can ſpeak as a Judge to a guilty perſon, and upbraid him of his faults with ſevere and terrible words, without failing of that reſpect that be owes to the dignity of a man. Hee accuſeth not but the will of the man, hee blames what hee hath done by his liberty, with out blameing any thing, that nature or fortune hath done in him.</p>
                        <p>Wee owe to one another an inviolable reſpect. You muſt not refuſe, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, nor the poor, what juſtice obligeth us to pay them, ſince they have on the Image of God as well as others.</p>

                        <p>Submiſſion and obedience, are the only means for Wives to reign in their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and there to uſurp the empire, that the Husband poſſeſſeth by the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the ſweetneſs and modeſty of the Wife, which puts an equality between the Sexes, and which makes the Government belong without difference, to the one and the other.</p>
                        <p>God has not intended, that authority should be, but for one of the two; But he would, That nature should give it freely to the Man; and that the Woman should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it by humility. A Wife who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, not to pleaſe her ſelf but in the Will and commands of her Husband, puts him quickly in a condition, not to dare, and not to be able to command any thing, but that which pleaſeth ſuch a Wife.</p>
                        <p>Among truths that one often forgets to obſerve, here is one moſt remarkable;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:206831:81"/>That the perſon of the Man, was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the perſon of the Woman, but after their ſin was committed; that before this miſery happen'd, there was a perfect equality between the two Sexes, and that during the days of innocence, their Life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of the Creator, failed not of being a glorious Image, of that which paſſed in the glorious Trinity.</p>
                        <p>In effect, one of the moſt incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things of this myſtery, is that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Father and the Son, infinitely equal in their greatneſs and perfections, are the ſame alſo in the Soverainty of their Rank, and in their mutual independance; although the one were the Principle of the other: and that comes, according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from this, that they are united by an infinite love, as ancient as their Being. Love, infinitely an enemy of dependance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, between perſons who infinitely love each other.</p>
                        <p>That is to ſay, that if in managing things here below, the Husband could not will any thing but by love, and the Wife do nothing but by love; although the Man were the principle of the Spouſe, Their ancient and juſt equality, should be as ſoon eſtablisht in its firſt Eſtate; That there should be no more amongſt them, neither Chief, nor Maſter, nor Miſtreſs, nor Commandment,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:206831:81"/>nor Obedience; but all that, miraculouſly transformed, should be nothing but love; And that among the viſible things of this World, there should be found, better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the joys of the future life, and of happy eternity, then the peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their mortal life.</p>

                        <p>The worſt is, when that this Idol is not without a Tongue, nor without Wit, nor without ſtudy, and that it ſays well what it knows. It is true, that all that in her paſſeth for a wonderful thing; but 'tis a miracle that every one is willing to ſee.</p>
                        <p>There enters into your Houſe abundance of Admirers: and she who hearkens to the praiſes of ſo many fine people, is ſcarce the more of an humour to praiſe and admire you, nor even to render herſelf admirable, when she ſees no body but your ſelf.</p>

                        <p>IN fine, contemn not your Friend, for contempt is the mortal wound of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the only wound that the heart of man can't bear.</p>
                        <p>Nature and Fortune which might render us contemptible, are not able to render us inſenſible and indifferent under contempt: habitude cannot accuſtome us thereto; and vertue which ſometimes may be able to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:206831:108"/>ſtiffle the grief, cannot blot out its remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                        <p>We have no experience, even that the quality of Perſons who contemn us, do leſſen the reſentment The praiſes that we receive from the part of our enemies, do not leave to be agreable to us: But the contempts that come by means of our greateſt friends, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wound the heart.</p>
                        <p>That which comes even from Princes or Maſters, is not ſweeter, nor better received. Whatever power or authority, that one hath over us, we never think they have a right to contemn us, when we are guilty; and thoſe who confeſs, that their crimes deſerve death, cannot believe they deſerve contempt.</p>
                        <p>Grace takes away from many the deſire of revenging themſelves, but it gives to very few contentment to ſuffer it. If ſome may love to be contemned for the Glory of God, I do not know, that many love thoſe however, that do contemn them.</p>

                        <p>TO choak the ſentiment of ill words, that one gives you, or of wrong that one does you in buſineſs, have you often in your mind this undoubted truth.</p>

                        <p>When you have a difference with any body, you goe and relate the buſineſs, and ask of your friends, if it be not true, that you have wrong, and that you ought to revenge it: you have ſo much right on your ſide: you do and ſay ſo well; that each one confeſſes it &amp; anſwers you that 'tis true.</p>
                        <p>But to the end that you might better know the truth, tell them the whole; relate
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:206831:109"/>to them ingenuouſly, what your Conſcience knowes, touching the moſt enormous ſins, and shamefull ingratitudes that you have committed againſt God; and there shall no body ſay, but that you merit inſinitely more evil, and more contempt then you have as yet received.</p>
                        <p>During quarrells and ſuits at Law, the queſtion is, to know if you ought to deſtroy a Man, whom God makes uſe of, to punish in you great ſins, and to punish them by ſo ſmall an evill as that is, which you pretend that one doth you.
